        <p>    I, Ethan G. Perez, agree to abide by the terms in my Spring 2026 WEB115-n850 Web Markup and Scripting with my instructor, Aastha Saxena.</p>
        <p>    I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
        <p>    I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
        <p>Signed: Ethan G. Perez 15 January 2026</p>
